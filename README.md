## Project Overview

This repository serves as a **comparison study** between two different approaches to building web applications:

1. **Template-based approach**: Using the [Astro Launch UI Pro template](https://www.creative-tim.com/astro/launch-ui-pro/) from Creative Tim
2. **LLM-based approach**: Building from scratch using Gemini 2.5 Pro with only instructions and theme concepts

### Purpose

The goal is to evaluate the workflow efficiency, development speed, and final output quality when comparing:

- Working with a pre-built, professional template
- Starting from zero with AI assistance

### Comparison Repository

For the LLM-based approach example, see Jesse Casman's repository that demonstrates building an Astro site without using any template, relying solely on AI instructions and theme concepts.

## Key Findings

This comparison aims to explore:

- **Development Speed**: How quickly can you get a professional-looking site up and running?
- **Customization**: What are the trade-offs between template constraints and full creative control?
- **Maintenance**: How does ongoing development and updates differ between approaches?
- **Learning Curve**: Which approach is more accessible for different skill levels?
